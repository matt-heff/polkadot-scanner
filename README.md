Polkadot - Scanner challenge

When looking through this site to evaluate what I have done focus on the file

/content/applications/PolkadotTransactions/PageHeader.tsx

There are a tonne of files in here, the reason for this is I was wanting to evalue this reactJS template and create tutorial on using templates and then modifying them to suit your purpose.

To make this run:

yarn install
yarn start
